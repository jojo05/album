# Preact Photo Album

A simple photo album component, built using `preact-cli`.


## Goals 

This component goals are:

* preact-only: do not use `preact-compat`
* minimum set of dependencies: Only depends on `preact-portal`
* use as starting point to add more functionality


## Getting Started

```
Copy source files to your preact-cli project 
npm i -S preact-portal
```

or use codesandbox:

https://codesandbox.io/s/mmpzv84zkx - codesandbox project

> the SVG icons for this project don't render properly in codesanbox. Help!
