# Preact Photo Album

A simple photo album component, built using `preact-cli`.

[Demo](https://jojo05.github.com/album/)


## Goals 

This component goals are:

* preact-only: do not use `preact-compat`
* minimum set of dependencies: Only depends on `preact-portal`
* use as starting point to add more functionality


## Getting Started

Copy source files to an empty `preact-cli` project 

Add dependency:

```
npm i -S preact-portal
```

or use codesandbox:

https://codesandbox.io/s/mmpzv84zkx - codesandbox project

> the SVG icons for this project don't render properly in codesanbox. Help!
